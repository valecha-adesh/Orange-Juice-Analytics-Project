# Orange-Juice-Analytics-Project

The project deal with providing services for the Brand manager and Sales manager of a grocery store specific to their Orange Juice sales. The problems the brand manager faces are determining what variables influence the person’s probability sale of Minute Maid OJ, and which of those variables he/she can adjust the inputs on to maximize sales.  The sales manager is interested in knowing what is the probability of people buying Minute Maid over Citrus Hill.  We need to determine what variables influence a person’s probability of buying MM orange juice, on basis of that design the model which predict the probability customer buying the MM orange juice.


For answering queries raised by Brand manager, We used a logistic regression model with the five independent variables to determine the variables that influence sales of MM. 
Since the Sales manager is not interested in the particular variables that influence the purchase, We used a linear kernel, specifically an svmLinear to provide a predictive model to determine probability of buying MM.
